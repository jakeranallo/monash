HTML5AutoplayVideo-ios
======================

Quick and Simple HTML5 Autoplay Video app for use as a demo for iPhone and iPad


Why to use?
======================
While researching iOS and HTML5 videos inside UIWebviews for iOS 7, and iOS 8, there were a lot of interesting issues raised. This is a simple test bed project that uses the HTML5 <video> tag with the autoplay attribute to play video automatically in iOS. I'd seen a lot of different StackOverflow answers that involved Javascript loaded normally in the web view, injecting Javascript using UIWebView, and the autoplay attribute, and it was hard to sort out what was actually needed for this to work.
